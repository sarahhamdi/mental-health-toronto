# QPOC & WOC Mental Health Resources in Toronto

I started this because I get questions about therapy about 2-3 times a year. These recommendations are mostly for therapy for and by Queer People & Women of Colour in Toronto. YMMV. Please contribute or make a PR if you have any recommendations!

## üìö Definitions
- **Psychiatrist** - Someone who prescribes medication, sometimes does psychology.

- **Psychologist** - Someone who practices psychology. A member of the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO)

- **Registered Social Worker (RSW)** - Someone with a Masters of Social Work (MSW) and registered with the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers.

- **Counsellor** - Someone who may or may not be an RSW.

- **Therapist** - can include any of the above, but usually doesn't include psychiatrists who do not provide therapy services.

## üí∏ Paying for Therapy in Ontario
**OHIP** will only cover **psychiatrists** or **medical doctors** who also practice psychology (see: Vaidya and Mcdonough below). They are rare. If you do find someone like that, you will likely need **a referral** from a doctor (physician). Take the name of the person you want treatment from, and ask your doctor to make a referral for that specific person. Sometimes your medical doctor can provide stopgap therapy until a referral comes through.

**Private insurance** may only cover certain types of therapists, for example, psychologists but not social workers (e.g. they will cover Malik-Noor but not Takeda, below). It's best to check with your insurance company before you contact someone, so you're not out hundreds of dollars.

- Psychotherapy costs around **$90-$150** if you are paying out of pocket.

- Some therapists have a **sliding scale**! It means you pay be able to pay what you can, within a range. You should ask.

- **Community health centres** and **psychotherapy students** are more affordable, and sometimes free.

CHCs have very affordable and population-specific therapy services but they also have very long waiting lists (3-9 months). They are not to be relied on during a time of crisis, unless it is physical.

## üöë In Crisis?
Most people think of a crisis as a situation where you need to call the ambulance, immediately. A crisis does not always look like that - it can be crying uncontrollably for days, constant anxiety attacks, suicidal thoughts, etc.

- If you are in crisis but can wait for people to get back to you, **tell the provider you are contacting that you are in crisis**. Sometimes this can speed up communication with them, or push you higher up the waiting list.

- If you are in crisis and cannot wait, you can call the **Distress Centre** at **416-408-HELP (4357)**, the **Gerstein Centre Crisis Line** at **416-929-5200**, or access any of [these specific crisis lines](http://toronto.cmha.ca/mental-health/find-help/are-you-in-crisis/). 

- If you need immediate help can **walk into CAMH's emergency** at  250 College Street, Toronto, Ontario. Check out [these threads on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/search?q=camh&restrict_sr=on) for people's experience doing this, if you want more insight.

- Call 911 if you need an ambulance, firefighter, or police help.
